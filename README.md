# Stellar Astrophysics: Project 1

This project is a program that numerically solves the dimensionless Lane-Emden equation by way of a second-order Runge Kutta method, as well as plot analytic solutions
alongside.

## Getting Started

All that is required is to run the program and the graphed solutions will appear as a new window. Close this window to see next plot, close last plot to terminate program. Misc. data will appear in terminal, however this is also available in the report.

### Prerequisites

To ensure this program runs properly, be sure to have the following libraries:

* numpy
* matplotlib
* math
* csv

If these are not installed the program will not run. These programs can be installed in the terminal via pip, or in Anaconda.

Also, please ensure to download the entire repository in order to obtain the CSV with data from the standard solar model.
