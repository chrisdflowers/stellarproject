# Stellar Astrophysics: Project 1

This project is a program that numerically solves the dimensionless Lane-Emden equation by way of a second-order Runge Kutta method, as well as plot analytic solutions
alongside.

## Getting Started

All that is required is to run the program and the graphed solutions will appear as a new window. Close this window to terminate the program.

### Prerequisites

To ensure this program runs properly, be sure to have the following libraries:

numpy
matplotlib
math

If these are not installed the program will not run. These programs can be installed in the terminal via pip, or in Anaconda.
